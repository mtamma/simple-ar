# simple-ar
Minimal recipe that gets you a mobile-browser AR experience in ±30 minutes:  
- A marker image (e.g. a printed QR-code-like picture)  
- When the user points their phone camera at that image, a 3-D spaceship appears, animates, and “launches” upward  
- No app install – it runs in Safari / Chrome / Samsung Internet on ARCore (Android) or ARKit (iOS) devices
